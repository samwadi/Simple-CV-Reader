I have created 2 versions for this project, one with simple logic and coding, and the second with pretrained libraries and AI tools.

In both cases the desired output is met, and the system returns all the desired information from scanning a CV. But I have realized that my own cv format is build in a way that is difficult for the automated tools to read and scan, it extracts the desired information but some data is mixed with the other, and they are not well displayed.

On the other hand, the program should work effectively with most CV formats.

Note that the first script (main.py) does not have a GUI.
